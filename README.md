# ðŸ§  Trained Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a trained machine learning model built using Python and scikit-learn. The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and saving the final model for reuse.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model using a structured dataset. The final trained model is saved for future predictions.
